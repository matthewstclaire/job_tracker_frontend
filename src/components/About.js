import React, { Component } from 'react';

class About extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
            <h1>About Page</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>
           
           This simple app serves a purpose as a jumping off point for all React apps I intend to build in the future. There are many goals I hope to accomplish. 

           For now you are able to:
           -Login
           -Submit a Job
           -View all jobs
           -Search through jobs
                
            </p>
                
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default About;
